## Coding Quest Q: Gender bias

**_Finish [Section 28](../exercises/28_advanced_text_processing.md) before attempting this quest._**



**Q.1.** ⭐⭐ In one or more texts of your choice, do female characters appear more often (than one would expect based on overall frequency) as grammatical objects than as subjects, compared to male characters? Consider using both pronouns and names (proper nouns); common nouns are more tricky (can you foresee why?). To map names to genders, either manually compile a resource for the names in your text, or search the web to find and download lists of male and female names (which you can then `open` and `read` into Python).
