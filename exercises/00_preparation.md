# Python for Linguists 2023

## 0. Preparation (Python, PyCharm)

Effort profile: `▁▁▂▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁` 



**0.1.** Without searching the web, what do you think Python is?

**0.2.** Without searching the web, how do you think programming works, roughly?

**0.3.** ⭐ What do you hope to learn or gain from this course? (Simply 'a diploma' is a valid answer too, albeit somewhat uninspiring.) Write your answer down.

**Something to keep in mind:** Exercises marked by one or several stars (⭐) are worth spending a bit more time on. In this case: resist settling for a quick answer and take some time to reflect on the question. Later on, stars will be indicative of how substantial an exercise is, comparatively, to help you manage your time. (Here 'substantial' could mean either a lot of work, or a lot of thinking, or both).

**0.4.** This course is for 5 EC. How many hours of study does this represent? Divided over around 15 weeks and with some extra exam preparation, how many hours a week does this represent?

**0.5.** Given the foregoing, and your personal goals, how many hours a week do you _want_ to spend on this course? (Consider opening your calendar to schedule a regular, recurring block of time in which you will do your homework. Give the recurring calendar event a name that reflects your goal (e.g., `improve my programming` can be better than `Python homework`).)

**0.6.** How will your grade for this course be determined? Have a quick read through the [Prospectus description](https://studiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/courses/113158/python-for-linguists) for this course.

**0.7.** Have a look at the [schedule](../README.md). Which of the many [exercise sections](../exercises/) are not covered by the homework, hence optional? Also have a look at the class topics and the additional [coding quests](../quests/): which ones seem interesting to you?

**0.8.** Prior to the initial class please already install the **PyCharm IDE** on your laptop: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ . The 'community edition' is freely available for every operating system, and more than sufficient for our needs. Installation is user-friendly, and you can install it without changing any of the default settings (or tweak them if you know what they do). 

_If you somehow cannot install it, please consider asking your fellow students for help. Should that fail, I may be able to help, and there will be time to figure it out during the first class._

**Something to keep in mind:** You can write Python programs in any plain text editor (or even with pen on paper!), but many tools exist to make programming easier, safer and more enjoyable. Most programmers work in an **IDE** ('Integrated Development Environment'), which typically contains a text editor with features such as _syntax highlighting_, _style checking_, coding help and auto-completion, as well as tools for running and debugging your programs, version management, even code sharing.

**0.9.** Once you have installed PyCharm, execute it (e.g., launch it from the start menu) and on the PyCharm entry screen click the big '+' button to create a _new project_. Again, all the default settings are fine. If Python is not yet installed on your system, PyCharm offers to do this for you when you click "create". Please do so, and again, the default Python version is fine. (To clarify: Python is a programming language. PyCharm is a program to help you code programs in that language.)

**0.10.** Inside your newly created project, have a look at the file `main.py` (which, on the default settings, PyCharm will have created for you) and try to run it.

- - - - - -
**Something to keep in mind:** There are two main ways of executing Python code, i.e., of _applying the Python interpreter to your code_. The first is to use the _editor_ to write your Python code a file, and then 'run' the file as a whole. The second is to enter your code in an 'interactive Python interpreter', called **Python console** in PyCharm, executing each command directly.
- - - - -

**0.11.** In PyCharm, see if you can find the editor (in which the file `main.py` opened), the 'run' panel (likely a tab at the bottom of your screen) where the output of `main.py` displays, and the Python Console (another tab).

**0.12.** As a student you can apply for the free PyCharm _educational license_ (https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students). I would recommend getting this, mainly because it will let you host unlimited sessions of Code With Me (https://www.jetbrains.com/code-with-me/), in case you want to program together with a friend at a distance.
