# Python for Linguists 2023

This is the repository for the 2023 edition of the BA Linguistics course [**Python for linguists**](https://studiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/courses/113158/python-for-linguists) in Leiden, not to be confused with the course **Language for pythons**.

- [Class notes](classes/) will be updated during the course, often during the lectures.
- No big changes are expected to the schedule below, the [exercises](exercises/), or the [Coding Quests](quests/), but small mistakes may be corrected when found. To ensure you are looking at the latest version, simply keep coming here in your browser rather than downloading the files to your computer.
- [Exercise solutions](exercises/solutions/) will be uploaded generally after homework is due, and not necessarily for all exercises.
- The first couple of weeks, all homework exercises marked by '✉️' must be submitted that week (in a single submission) through [Brightspace](https://brightspace.universiteitleiden.nl/d2l/home/210116).
- After that, the homework begins to include Coding Quests, and each week you need to submit your solution to the Coding Quest for that week. If the homework for that week lists multiple Coding Quests, you can choose one of them and submit your solution.  

_**What are all these .md files?** These files are formatted with **markdown**. Github automatically displays them with a nice layout, and the PyCharm IDE which we will use provides similar support, in case you do want to download the files. However, opening these files in any other editor will likely not yield the prettiest results._
